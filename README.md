Sportshack Supplement Depot - https://sportshack-front.vercel.app/ (will be changed to www.sportshacksupplementdepot.com) - 
A website designed for a business in Lafayette, LA.

Why? The original design of the website was cluttered, redundant, and difficult to navigate.
It was created using Shopify, but the online store wasn't functional. I offered to recreate
the site from scratch with the hopes of creating more business for the owner. Users can see 
the address, phone number, and hours of operation immediately upon visiting the site. They 
can view the smoothie menu along with the nutrition facts for each size. Also, users can 
see the sandwhich/wrap options. This new design is much easier to use, and the most important
aspects of the business are featured.

On the landing page, a simple introduction explains what the business does and who it serves. 
From there, each menu item will take the user to a featured part of the store. The goal is to 
drive as many people to visit the store in person so the full experience can be had.

I'm using a self-built server/API to store the nutrition facts for every smoothie. 2 tables are 
used... 1 for each smoothie size offered.
